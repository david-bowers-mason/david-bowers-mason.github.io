    <h1>My Identity and Values</h1>
    <h3>2 April 2024</h3>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
        Contractor doing either web dev or ux/ui dev (ideally working flexibly enough for a 3 day weekend. I can dream)
    </p>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>
        As I mentioned in the blog, I'm easily distracted, so I tend to have to shape my environment to help me focus on my tasks. No distractions, access to the outdoors to get up and go for a walk. Easy access to people I get along with so I can have a break and charge my battery through socialisation. On the positive side, I am a very curious person, so even though I am distracted easily, it is often by rabbit holes that then become useful to me later on. 
    </p>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
        Communication. Being more able to reach out when I'm struggling!
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
    <h4>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
    <p>
        Super important to me is getting to know people and establishing that ease of communication so that if situations arise where we need to work together or address issues, things go as smoothly as possible!
    </p>
    <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>
    <p>
        I've told my partner to check in with me as an external party to tell me to check in with my facilitator/liaison so I can cut through the anxiety that tells me not to.
    </p>
    <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
    <p>
        It’s so much easier to ask for advice and help in person. I’ll revisit this when we’ve had the meeting about hybrid learning, but ideally I’d love to be present in-person as much as possible!
    </p>

    <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
    <p>
        Being able to Explain Like I'm 5. I've done one or two courses where things only start to click at the end because there's a set of basic concepts that were just assumed to be common knowledge.
    </p>
    <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
    <p>
        The only solid block-out time that I have at the moment is on Friday 12 April. I'll be heading out of town to see my family. Apart from that I'm locked in for the course.
    </p>
