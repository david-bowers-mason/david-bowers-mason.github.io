    <h1>Relative, absolute and fixed positioning</h1>
    <h3>2 April, 2024</h3>
    
    <p>
      In web design, relative, absolute and fixed positioning describe how elements are positioned on a webpage (elements are positioned "static" by default, but we won't cover that here!).
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
            <p>Positioned "relative" to its normal position. If you adjust the 'top', 'right', 'bottom', or 'left' properties, it will be shifted away from its normal position and other content will not be moved to fit into any gap it may have left.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
            <p>Positioned according to where the nearest ancestor was positioned. If you adjust the 'top', 'right', 'bottom', or 'left' properties, it will be shifted away from the nearest ancestor based on those coordinates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
            <p>Positioned outside of the normal flow of the document. Elements with this positioning will remain in the same position even if the page is scrolled. If you adjust the 'top', 'right', 'bottom', or 'left' properties, it will be shifted relative to its position in the viewport.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are two other positioning tags: static and sticky. Static elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties, instead it is positioned in the flow of the page. Sticky elements seem to follow the regular flow of the page, until the viewport passes a certain position, then they become 'fixed', and remain in the same place relative to the viewport.
