    <h3>Problem Solving, or, The Rubber Duck Approach</h3>
    <p>
        The rubber duck approach to debugging is a niche name for really quite an old method. The idea is this: when you want to debug your code, you should go through the program line by line, and explain it to a literal rubber duck (or whatever other stand-in for an audience you can get your hands on). In explaining step-by-step, you will often uncover the problem. As silly as it sounds, this approach helps with a couple of really big sources of problems in any workflow:
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Generalization</h4>
    <p>
        Writing, coding, creating documents, these are all extremely high-level tasks which take a LOT of brain power. In order to be able to undertake tasks like these efficiently, your brain <strong>generalises</strong> smaller component tasks, so it can focus on the big picture. Instead of reading every letter of a word, you see the general shape of a word and your brain fills in the gaps. Instead of noticing every piece of data in a document, you might disregard the content that isn't meant to be there, because you're not spotting the finer details, you're just spotting the general shape of the information. It's the same reason we tend to find it difficult to spot our own typos in something we've written. Rubber ducking forces us to de-generalize what's in front of us, and look at it step-by-step again.

    <h4>Cognition</h4>
    <p>
        When you speak aloud you are tying more senses into you experience, aiding your memory, attention, and comprehension. It has been demonstrated that <a link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969489/">speaking text aloud helps to solidify the text into your long-term memory</a>, leading to advantages in the long-run in navigating future problems.

    <h4>I'm not a perfect user of the method</h4>
    <p>
        Just this week I was working on a function in Javascript where I was meant to take a sentence input, remove certain words, then return the modified sentence. I spent a couple of hours on what felt like it should be a relatively easy challenge. I looked at forums, previous questions from classmates, and all the rest. I copied and pasted different approaches - and they worked! - but I had no idea why my approach wasn't working, until I finally went through line by line and spotted the problem. I hadn't told the function to "return" anything. It was such an obvious error, and one I would have spotted much earlier if I had used the Rubber Duck Approach.
