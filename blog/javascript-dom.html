    <h4 id="Javascript">Javascript</h4>
    <p>
        We’ve talked about the relationship between HTML and CSS before, and how HTML creates the content and basic structure of a webpage, while CSS formats and styles that content. Well javascript takes all of the wonderful stuff from those first two and makes it interactive. It features the ability to manipulate and edit the content of a webpage’s html so that when we provide input, it can present us with different outputs
    </p>
    <h4 id="Control flow">Control flow</h4>
    <p>
        Let’s have a look at the different kinds of flow and how they can be explained in our chosen analogy!
    </p>

    <h5>Sequential Flow</h5>
    <p>We’re following the recipe step by step, in order. Just like each step in the recipe comes after the last - i.e., we peel the veges, THEN we chop them, THEN we roast them - each step in the code comes after the last.</p>

    <h5>Conditional Flow</h5>
    <p>
        Now before you cook your veges you’ve got to pick which ones we’re going to eat. I know I have certain ‘go to’s, but if something’s on special at the supermarket I’ll probably cook that instead. This could be a conditional variable: IF there’s a special on, cook that vege, ELSE we can just cook the usual.</p>

    <h5>Loop Flow</h5>
    <p>
        Imagine you’re chopping the veges for your wonderful roast, and you want to make sure you have enough to fill the oven dish. Well then you would probably end up repeating the same action a few times until you were done. You would probably wash the - let’s say it’s a potato - peel it, chop it, then put it in the dish. But you wouldn’t just keep on doing this forever of course. At some point you would stop, either when you run out of potatoes, or when you have enough potatoes for  the meal. This could be depressed as a loop that repeats until the condition “enough potatoes” is met.</p>

    <h5>Jump Flow</h5>
    <p>
        Now imagine one of your friends is coming to share the meal with you, and you want to make sure everything is edible for them. You want to put pine nuts on your roast veges for a bit of extra flair, but you should probably double-check that they don’t have any nut allergies before you do. So you check in with them: this is a jump flow that would look more or less like: “if my friend is allergic to nuts, skip the part where I would add the pine nuts and just go to the next step.”</p>

    <h4 id="Functions">Functions</h4>
    <p>
        Not to run a metaphor into the ground, but imagine that we’re STILL cooking that meal from before (I personally take ages in the kitchen so like, that’s not so far-fetched for me). A lot of the time in a recipe it will tell you to “dice”, “sautee”, “braise” your different ingredients. When I was a kid and I first saw these terms, I had no idea what they were wanting me to do. In javascript, we can imagine these words as functions that had not yet been defined for me. When my mum explained that dicing meant chopping into small cubes, then from that moment on, any recipe could ‘call’ the function “dice”, and I would know exactly what to do. Without that keyword, every recipe would instead have to explain “chop the vegetables into small cubes between 1cm and 1.5 cm using a sharp chopping knife…” - it would take up way too much space! 
    </p>
    <p>
        The function “dice” can also have a parameter passed into it. You see, we don’t just dice in a vacuum, we dice our ingredients. So a recipe usually tells us to dice(carrots) or dice(onions), so that we know where to direct our knife!
    </p>

    <h4 id="The DOM">The DOM</h4>
    <p>
        Okay, I’m really married to this whole cooking thing we’ve got going on, so I’m going to try keep it going as much as I can for this last section too. The DOM or Document Object Model is a programming interface that represents our documents as nodes and objects to let programming languages interact with our pages. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you like, you can imagine HTML as a recipe. It outlines what happens to the ingredients (elements) and in what order while we prep a meal. Now as we follow the recipe and make our meal, we’re essentially creating a dynamic model of the recipe in our kitchen. The kitchen would be… I don’t know, maybe the web browser in this analogy?
    </p>
    <p>
        Now since we’re the chef, we have the ability to tweak the recipe as we go. We don’t have canola oil so we substitute shortening, we want our sauce a bit stronger so we add some more balsamic vinegar. Javascript is our toolkit for making all these changes and variations to the state of the recipe. We’d use javascript to locate “dressing” in the html/recipe, and then edit its variable “balsamic vinegar” to increase it.
