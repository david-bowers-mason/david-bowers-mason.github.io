    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Whā - My Wellbeing Plan</h1>
    <h3>13 April 2024</h3>


    <h3>My the below segments outline my wellbeing plan during bootcamp at devacademy</h3>
    <h3>Taha Tinana</h3>
    <p>
        I find mental focus and sanctuary in exercise at the gym. Before I started course I maintained a schedule of going to the gym four times a week for resistance training. My commitment will be to maintain a schedule of going to the gym at least three times a week.
    </p>

    <h3>Taha Whānau</h3>
    <p>
        I have a group of close friends with whom one of my most cherished times of the week is meeting together to play boardgames and cook dinner for each other on Sundays. My commitment will be to not miss one of these meetups.
    </p>

    <h3>Taha Hinengaro</h3>
    <p>
        Meditation and mindfulness are things which I'm a big fan of, but are often the first thing to drop off my priority list during times of stress - even though they aren't things that take a huge amount of time or effort. My commitment is to dedicate at least 10 minutes of the evening shortly before bedtime to meditation.
    </p>

    <h3>Taha Wairua</h3>
    <p>
        Art and artistic expression is deeply integral to my sense of self. My commitment will be to make time, even if it's just during a short break, to do some art. Be that poetry, drawing, or music.
    </p>

    <h3>Whenua</h4>
    <p>
        The importance of place, and feeling embedded in my environment rather than just existing in a void somewhere between my bed and workstation cannot be understated. I often find that I tell myself I "don't have time to go for a walk right now", until I get to a point where I simply <strong>need</strong> to get out of the house. Then I find once I do get out my mind becomes clearer, my spirit becomes happier, and I can often come back to the problems I face with a better approach.
