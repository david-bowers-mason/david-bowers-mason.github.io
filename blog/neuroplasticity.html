    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

        My first introduction to the idea of neuroplasticity was in high school. I was in year 10, which I guess if you're American would be the ninth grade? Our teacher was this towering man called Mr Beasley. He had a degree from Cambridge university and a lifetime of experience teaching English throughout africa and the Middle East, and by some bizarre twist of fate he had decided to settle down in rural New Zealand (he also had a wild catalogue of stories about his personal life, including claims of flatting with Hugh Laurie during uni, and getting drunk on confiscated booze with Somali police, please help me, I'm getting too sidetracked from the point of the blog).

        Anyway the point of all this is that one day he sat the whole class down in front of a Ted talk about 'growth mindsets' versus 'fixed mindsets'. It was the first time the idea had been introduced to me, and honestly I came away from that class feeling betrayed. You see, for all that my parents are wonderful people, and prioritized raising me and my siblings as well as they could, I began to realized that my whole life there had been SUCH an emphasis on the idea of talent. Any complement paid to me or my siblings revolved around the fact that we were all so 'naturally gifted'. Yes we were encouraged to believe that we could do anything, but not through effort, rather because we somehow possessed an innate talent that made it possible. Reflecting on this, I saw that my own reactions to failure and hardship were very strongly influenced by the belief that if I failed, it was a reflection on my innate nature/talents, instead of it being an opportunity for improvement.
