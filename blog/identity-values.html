        I'll kick this off with a time that I "made an ethical decision". I've put the airquotes because it can be hard even with a couple of years' perspective to know for sure what's right or wrong. Additionally, I'm not going to describe a particular decision, but more just a general gist of a collection of decisions. I've known so many groups of friends, or organizations, where everythings peachy, right up until one person causes a big stink. They might be someone new to the group who just has not understood the energy/dynamic of the existing members. They might be an existing member who has made a decision that's left everyone else scratching their heads (I'm sure I've been that person myself from time to time!). I usually find that I am the person in any given group who, if the stink is big enough, and if enough people are wrinkling their noses, will go and talk to the stink-causer. Usually it's just a conversation like "hey, how are things? Hey you did x right? I was actually wondering whether there's any room to have a chat, because I'm more of a y person, but maybe we could meet in the middle?" But sometimes the conversations are more like full-blown interventions. To avoid this blowing up into a several-page-blog, I'm going to jump to the next question!

        I - like approximately 20% of the general population - have ADHD . You can't get more "evidence"-y than a formal diagnosis! If you subscribe to the 'astrology for linkedin users' hobby that is the 16 personalities framework, then I'm an ENFP; a "campaigner". Some people embrace their adhd brains, framing it as their "superpower" (I don't want to take this away from them, if that's how you feel then all power to you!), but I am very aware that what it means for me is that I need to be constantly vigilant of distractions in my environment. My lack of focus and ease with which I can get sidetracked have been things that I've tried to work on, with varying degrees of success. I have found, though, that I get the most bang for my buck from putting effort into controlling my environment rather than myself. If I can shape the space in which I live and work, then that will in turn shape my outputs.

        Regardless of my weaknesses when it comes to focus, I am persevering. When I studied my Master of International Relations, I often felt like I was hitting my head against a brick wall. When I was meant to be researching and writing my dissertation I would spend hours sitting at the computer looking at a blank screen, trying to force myself to do something - anything - but I couldn't make myself act. I decided to have a break from study to get into the right headspace, so I took a year off to work on myself and to do other things. Then I came back and finished the degree. It hadn't become easier, but I had gained some perspective. And most importantly, I was no longer mentally fatigued.

        I have definitely faced challenges in the workplace when my style has bumped up against others. I have been a playwright/theatre creator in a production company with several friends, and because of the lower level of organizational structure present in a theatre company in comparison to, say, a government department, conflicts can arise to which there is no "correct" way through, or no "by the book" solution. Solving problems like these takes dialogue, and a willingness to be vulnerable. It's often frightening being completely open and honest with people, but you can't get what you want unless you're willing to fully express it, and you can't help others get what they want unless they're willing to open up and tell you. Equally important is knowing when to give way if you see that an issue is important to someone else when it's not that important to you, and knowing to say sorry when you didn't realize this was the case!

        There are absolutely other situations where all having different styles has been an absolute blessing, and I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by a group of friends and co-creators who have viewpoints that constantly challenge me, and provide insights I could never have thought of. These days, whenever I'm going to make a big decision about my life, I have about 3 or 4 people who I always tell it to before I make the jump. Knowing them, there'll always be some question they ask that makes me go "huh, I didn't think of it like that before!"
