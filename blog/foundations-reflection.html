    <h3>Answer each of the following questions:</h3>
    <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
        1. Even when I think I'm not too proud to ask questions and look like I 'don't get what's going on', that pride will find a way to sneak on back.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. As a result of that, it's very easy to feel shame over things. If that happens, talk to someone! Nothing will dispel that feeling faster than having a conversation with a third party.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Even when you feel like garbage, you're often your own worst critic. You can do things you didn't expect!

    <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
</h4>
    <p>
        As with any trade, you're not an island. You'll be working with people, learning from people, teaching people, and maybe at some point leading people. Not only that, but it takes someone with a strong knowledge of their self to be able to really see and fix not just their mistakes, but the approach that was causing the mistakes in the first place.
    </p>
    <br>


    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
        Just how much there still is to learn after having worked on these skills for decades now.
    </p>
    <br>


    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
</h4>
    <p>
        Consistency. There are challenges to create a habit, or a commitment to yourself, and often I'll get to the end of the day and THEN remember the challenge. Presence of mind is important, as well as setting up your environment to guide you towards success.
    </p>


    <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
</h4>
    <p>
        This isn't just a course to learn coding, it's a course to prepare students for the workplace. The skills learnt in the core section are vital for that. 
    </p>

        <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
</h4>
    <p>
        As I mentioned previously, I might have thought they were repeating stuff that I already knew back at the start of the course. However, it has definitely become clear to me that you never stop learning with these things. There's always a tip, an insight, a reflection, that you never thought of before. This is a constant process, and the important thing is to form a habit of self-questioning and exploration that will stay with you into the future.
